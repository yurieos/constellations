Two thousand years ago, Roman emperors and enslaved people alike found wisdom in Stoicism. Today, Silicon Valley executives and professional athletes turn to the same ancient texts.

The core Stoic insight is deceptively simple: we cannot control external events, only our responses to them. Marcus Aurelius, ruling an empire while battling plague and war, wrote in his journal: "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

## Practical Stoicism

- **The dichotomy of control**: Focus energy only on what you can influence
- **Negative visualization**: Imagine losing what you have to appreciate it fully
- **The view from above**: Zoom out to gain perspective on daily troubles

Seneca advised practicing poverty occasionally—not as punishment, but to realize that our fears of loss are often worse than loss itself. In an age of anxiety, these ancient practices offer a path to tranquility.
