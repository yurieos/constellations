excerpt: "Gutenberg's invention didn't just spread information—it transformed how humanity thinks, learns, and challenges authority. Before 1440, a single Bible took three years to copy by hand. Within fifty years of the printing press, over 20 million books existed. The Protestant Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and Enlightenment all rode this wave of democratized knowledge."

Before 1440, books were copied by hand. A single Bible took a scribe three years to produce. Knowledge was scarce, expensive, and controlled by those in power.

Johannes Gutenberg's movable type printing press changed everything. Within fifty years, over 20 million books had been printed. Ideas could spread faster than any authority could suppress them.

## Ripple Effects

The Protestant Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment—none would have been possible without mass printing. Luther's 95 Theses spread across Europe in weeks, not decades.

We're living through a similar transformation now. The internet has made everyone a publisher. Like the printing press, it democratizes information while creating new challenges: misinformation, fragmentation, information overload.

History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. Understanding Gutenberg helps us navigate our own revolution.
