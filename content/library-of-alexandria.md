Scholars like Euclid and Eratosthenes worked within its walls, making discoveries that still echo today. What lessons can we learn from its rise and gradual decline?"

The Library of Alexandria was the most famous library of the ancient world. Founded in the 3rd century BCE under Ptolemy I, it aimed to collect all the world's knowledge.

At its peak, the library held an estimated 400,000 scrolls. Scholars from across the Mediterranean came to study, debate, and advance human understanding. Euclid wrote his *Elements* here. Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy.

The library's destruction wasn't a single dramatic event but a gradual decline over centuries—through fires, conquests, and neglect. Yet its legacy endures: the dream of universal knowledge accessible to all.

Today, we carry more information in our pockets than Alexandria ever held. The question remains: what will we do with it?
