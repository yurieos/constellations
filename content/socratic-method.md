Socrates wrote nothing. Yet his method of inquiry—asking probing questions rather than lecturing—remains the foundation of Western education and critical thinking.

The approach is disarmingly simple: instead of asserting what you know, ask questions that expose contradictions and assumptions. Socrates compared himself to a midwife, helping others give birth to their own understanding.

## Why Questions Matter

When we're told something, we might accept or reject it. When we discover something through our own reasoning, we truly understand it. The Socratic method transforms passive listeners into active thinkers.

Today, this technique powers:
- Law school classrooms
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Design thinking workshops
- Scientific peer review

"The unexamined life is not worth living," Socrates declared. Twenty-four centuries later, his questions still echo.
